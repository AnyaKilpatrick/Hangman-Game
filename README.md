# Hangman-Game

For this assignment I picked "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" theme: all words, sounds and styles are connected with the movie.
Key events were used to listen for the letters that players will type.

Game code is organized as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. 

Game playes main theme soundtrack on the background until the player guesses all characters of the word correctly.
After that main content will switch to the next random word, and on the left side player will see a picture and will hear a sound connected with the just guessed word, till next word is guessed.

Press any key to get started!
Wins: (shows # of times user guessed the word correctly).

When the game starts, the word is displayed like this: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

As the user guesses the correct letters, they will be revealed : g e _ _ a _ _.

Letters Already Guessed: (List of letters the user has already guessed. Letters will not repeat if you press them again).

Number of Guesses Remaining: (shows # of guesses remaining for the user). 

After the user wins/loses the game automatically chooses another word and make the user play it.
